# Firearm-Protecor
An application will be a red app that anyone can download to help them in their time of need for protection.

The app will also be used to help verify a person and or their criminal records.
While there is no definite answer that can help stop gun control this program can at least limit and be a major big step to help slow it down.

This can alert the authorities to your area or it can help your community by uploading information on past criminals in your neighborhood.
This program can help my community by preventing gun violence, robbery, breaking and entering, carjacking, etc.
The 5 sources that talk about the problems in my community are WCBI, WTVA, Fox News, Columbus Radio Station, Google when you search Columbus, MS.
